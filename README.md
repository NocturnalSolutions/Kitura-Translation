# Kitura Translation

*Warning: This project is still in an experimental state.* Be prepared for API changes to occur without warning, and let's not even get started about bugs.

Kitura Translation allows for [Kitura](http://www.kitura.io) web sites to present content in different languages. Translations are stored in industry-standard PO files.

(Kitura Translation does not strictly depend on Kitura and theoretically could be used without it, but it is intended to be used with Kitura primarily.)

## Usage

@todo lol - but if you're halfway familiar with Swift, you can figure it out by checking out the code.

## Rough todo list

- Moar comments, documentation, and code standards adherence!
- Confirm and work around the case of two page loads in two different languages causing one to get the other language's translations (a race condition). I'm pretty sure this will happen but I haven't actually seen it yet.
